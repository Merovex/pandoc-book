# Pandoc Novel

## Acknowledgements

My earlier forays into plaintext to Novel were in LaTeX, then a [custom-modified Ruby approach](#verku). This toolchain is a pivot to a simpler one and owes appreciation to:

* Scott Selisker, [A Plain Text Workflow for Academic Writing with Atom](http://u.arizona.edu/~selisker/post/workflow/) & KDheepak, [Writing Technical Papers with Markdown](https://blog.kdheepak.com/writing-papers-with-markdown.html). Both encouraged me to re-build a toolchain.
* Dennis Tenen and Grant Wythoff, [Sustainable Authorship in Plain Text using Pandoc and Markdown](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown), for encouraging me to focus on Pandoc for the toolchain.
* Pascal Wagler, [Eisvogel](https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template), for giving away that one can pull down the stock Pandoc LaTeX template and modify it.
* BP, [Pandoc Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/pandoc-discuss/JVAKdezOoVg/RCY30ypTEQAJ), for helping me change the Horizontal Rule into a Plain Fancy Break.
* [Memoir class](https://ctan.org/pkg/memoir?lang=en), for having code on Plain Fancy Break that I was able to copy over.
