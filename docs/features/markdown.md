**Write in Markdown.**
Write your content in Markdown, which lets you focus on your prose with minor styling. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the worldâ€™s most popular markup languages.
It's the native markup language for Github, which lets you preview your content in Github effortlessly.
Markdown is more of a style than a format, meaning that it intends to provide a predictable structure to your text so computers can detect natural patterns and convert the text intelligently.
You can think of Markdown a little like a word processor's styles.
It's future-proof because it is a plain-text format that is usable and openable in modern word processors.
