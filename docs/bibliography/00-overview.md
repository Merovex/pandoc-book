# Bibliography

https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles

In this section, we will add a bibliography to our document and then
convert from Chicago to MLA formats.

If you are not using a reference manger like Endnote or Zotero, you
should. We prefer Zotero, because, like Pandoc, it was created by the
academic community and like other open-source projects it is released
under the GNU General Public License. Most importantly for us, your
reference manager must have the ability to generate bibliographies in
plain text format, to keep in line with our "everything in plain text"
principle. Go ahead and open a reference manager of your choice and add
some sample entries. When you are ready, find the option to export your
bibliography in BibTeX (.bib) format. Save your .bib file in your
project directory, and give it a reasonable title like "project.bib".

The general idea is to keep your sources organized under one centralized
bibliographic database, while generating specific and much smaller .bib
files that will live in the same directory as your project. Go ahead and
open your .bib file with the plain-text editor of your choice.[^4]
