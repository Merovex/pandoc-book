## Requirements

  -   **Zotero or Endnote**. Bibliographic reference software like Zotero
    and Endnote are indispensable tools for organizing and formatting
    citations in a research paper. These programs can export your
    libraries as a BibTeX file (which you will learn more about in Case
    2 below). This file, itself a formatted plain text document of all
    your citations, will allow you to quickly and easily cite references
    using `@tags`. It should be noted that it's also possible to type
    all of your bibliographic references by hand, using [our
    bibliography](https://github.com/dhcolumbia/pandoc-workflow/blob/master/pandoctut.bib)
    as a template.
